\section{Heuristics in the Adaptive A*}

\paragraph{Problem}
Implement and compare Repeated Forward A* and Adaptive A* with respect to their
runtime. Explain your observations in detail, that is, explain what you
observed and give a reason for the observation. Both search algorithms should
break ties among cells with the same f-value in favor of cells with larger
g-values and remaining ties in an identical way, for example randomly.

\paragraph{Solution}
