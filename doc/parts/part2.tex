\section{The Effects of Ties}

\paragraph{Problem} 
Repeated Forward A* needs to break ties to decide which
cell to expand next if several cells have the same smallest f-value. It can
either break ties in favor of cells with smaller g-values or in favor of cells
with larger g-values. Implement and compare both versions of Repeated Forward
A* with respect to their runtime or, equivalently, number of expanded cells.
Explain your observations in detail, that is, explain what you observed and
give a reason for the observation.
