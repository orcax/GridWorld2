\section{Heuristics in the Adaptive A*}

\paragraph{Problem}
The project argues that “the Manhattan distances are consistent in gridworlds
in which the agent can move only in the four main compass directions.” Prove
that this is indeed the case.

\paragraph{Solution}

\paragraph{Problem}
Furthermore, it is argued that “The h-values hnew(s) ... are not only
admissible but also consistent.” Prove that Adaptive A* leaves initially
consistent h-values consistent even if action costs can increase.

\paragraph{Solution}
