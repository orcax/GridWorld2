\section{Forward vs. Backward}

\paragraph{Problem}
Implement and compare Repeated Forward A* and Repeated Backward A* with respect
to their runtime or, equivalently, number of expanded cells. Explain your
observations in detail, that is, explain what you observed and give a reason
for the observation. Both versions of Repeated A* should break ties among cells
with the same f-value in favor of cells with larger g-values and remaining ties
in an identical way, for example randomly.

\paragraph{Solution}
