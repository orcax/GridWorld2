\section*{Abstract}
Heuristic search algorithms like A* can be adapted to solving path planning 
problems of directed goal and unknown environment In this report, we mainly 
discuss and evaluate three variants of A* algorithms, namely Repeated Forward 
A*, Repeated Backward A* and Adaptive A*. In the experiment, we first generate 
two sets of 1000 random grid-based maps, where one follows the assignment 
requirement containing approximate 30\% obstacles and 70\% roads, and the other 
is the set of corridor-like mazes generated by DFS with randomly expanded nodes. 
Then we compare three algorithms by such evaluation indices as number of 
expanded nodes, number of explored nodes, total cost of steps, optimal cost of 
steps, etc. The result shows that 1) the average number of expanded nodes per 
map and explored nodes per map of Adaptive A* are respectively 28.06\% and 
24.00\% less than those of Repeated 
Forward A*; 2) cost of steps for all three algorithms is pretty much the same. 
This indicates that Adaptive A* is greatly optimized in path replanning phase, 
while there is no significant improvement in actual moving phase. Finally, we 
discuss and calculate how to optimize data structures to store states as many 
as possible within only 4M memory. This is the practical problem in the situation
where computational resources are rare and precious.
